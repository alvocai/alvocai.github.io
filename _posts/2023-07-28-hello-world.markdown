This is de facto my first ever attempt at blogging.

I follow the advice of [Rachel Thomas][rachel-thomas] and [Jeremy Howard][jeremy-howard] - the founders of the fast.ai library and course - to write about what I'm learning in the same way that I would try to teach someone else, in order to deepen my understanding of the subject.

As the title of the blog suggests, I'm currently learning AI (Artificial Intelligence) using the freely available [fast.ai course][fastai-course] and so far I haven't been disappointed.

I will update my blog step by step as my journey continues.

If I don't make it, I'm sure no one will ever know. But, if I do, this blog will be filled with (hopefully) interesting topics and I will be happy to have kept at it.

Well, here goes nothing!
